## Hi there!

This is an experimental demo made to familiarize myself with [Search UI](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui) and [App Search](https://swiftype.com/app-search), and to help find bugs/pain points/constructive feedback.

I gotta say that Search UI is generally pretty fantastic - it took me what felt like seconds to spin up a working search interface with autocomplete & filters, and a little bit after that to get in the custom views and styling (opting to use completely custom CSS/Sass) that I needed.

For a dataset, I used 5 years worth of games from the [Seattle Indies Expo](https://six.seattleindies.org), a indie game festival I used to help organize/run! I thought it would be a neat example of real world data plus people get to check out cool video games.

This demo runs on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [React](https://reactjs.org). Thanks for checking it out!
